Lux is a library that makes data science easier by automating certain aspects of the data exploration process. Lux is designed to facilitate faster experimentation with data, even when the user does not have a clear idea of what they are looking for.

The [core Lux API](https://github.com/lux-org/lux/) is written in Python. This is the Jupyter widget extension for the Lux API, written in Typescript and React. 

To get started, install the Lux Jupyter widget through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lux-widget): 

```bash
npm i lux-widget
```

Here is an example of the lux-widget in action. The widget is generated based on commands to the Lux API. Users can interact with the widget and export selected visualizations into variables.
